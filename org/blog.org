but I intend to find out.

*Welcome!* 

It is odd that I have been online for so long (since 1986 or so)
but have never felt the need to publish content (apart from the occasional
piece of open source software, here and there).  There was one early
attempt, in hand-crafted HTML, around 1994, that I might try to resurrect
for posterity... but nothing since.

What changed?  I guess with the passage of time, my work took
me from being a "producer" to being more of a "mentor".  During my
career I began to notice the same problems, (and often, the same wrong
solutions) over and over, so I figured I might as well write down
some of my thoughts on these matters (not that I expect any to care
what /I/ think!)

Who am I?  A /defrocked astronomer/[fn:1], then a programmer[fn:2] in Australia,
where I still reside.  
A /rationalist/ because the only way we seem to have figured out things
which are actually true, without lying to ourselves, is the scientific 
method.
A /curmudgeon/, certainly, having been told at
the tender age of 17 by my favourite maths professor, no less, that I
had already achieved the cynicism of a 75 year old.  They call it pessimism;
I call it /being a realist/.  Never stopped me from being happy...


I now work as a consultant, principally (but not
exclusively) for small companies using [[https://clojure.org][clojure]].  



**** Notes

[fn:1] I obtained my Ph.D. from [[https://www.astro.caltech.edu/department/grad_alumni.html][Caltech in 1991]], in Cosmology, and worked 
for a few years at [[https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESTEC][the European Space Observatory]].

[fn:2] Although I worked at many places, the work I am most proud of
was performed at [[https://newsroom.accenture.com/industries/communications/accenture-to-acquire-maxamine-and-memetrics-expanding-digital-marketing-sciences-services.htm][Memetrics]], a now defunct company acquired by Accenture in 2008.

The question is: /who/ is doing the exporting?  I think
it's =org-hugo-auto-export-mode= in the /Local Variables/.

\( e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \)

 - Here we refer to [[/blog][Blog]]
 - And make a change
 - Here we refer to 
 #+begin_export html
 <a src="/">The home page</a>
 #+end_export

 - And here to an inner link on [[/blog/foo][the foo page]]
 - And highlighting is still failing.

 #+begin_src clojure 
   (defn foo
     "Do some foo"
     [x y]
     (log "Some foobar message")
     (+ x y))
 #+end_src

#+hugo: more

#+begin_src lisp :hl_lines 2 -n 20
  (message "This is line 1")
  (message "This is line 2")
  (message "This is line 3")
#+end_src

*** Equations:

LaTeX formatted equation: \( E = -J \sum_{i=1}^N s_i s_{i+1} \)

*** Another one

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
C = W\log_{2} (1+\mathrm{SNR})
\end{equation}

And that's /all/, folks!

* TODO Get snippets or templates for new blog entries

I think the combination I'm liking is:
 - Libre Baskerville for body text
 - Open Sans "Light Italic" 300 weight for headings.
