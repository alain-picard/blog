Welcome!  My name is /Alain Picard/!

These are the 
ramblings of a curmudgeonly programmer.  I like =emacs=, lispy languages,
=Unix™=, and intelligent discussion.  I'll be talking about all those
things, and then some.  Feel free to reach out via email, or by

*Welcome!* 

It is odd that I have been online for so long (since 1986 or so)
but have never felt the need to publish content (apart from the occasional
piece of open source software, here and there).  There was one early
attempt, in hand-crafted HTML, around 1994, that I might try to resurrect
for posterity... but nothing since.

What changed?  I guess with the passage of time, my work took
me from being a "producer" to being more of a "mentor".  During my
career I began to notice the same problems, (and often, the same wrong
solutions) over and over, so I figured I might as well write down
some of my thoughts on these matters (not that I expect any to care
what /I/ think!)

Who am I?  A /defrocked astronomer/[fn:1], then a programmer[fn:2] in Australia,
where I still reside.  
A /rationalist/ because the only way we seem to have figured out things
which are actually true, without lying to ourselves, is the scientific 
method.
A /curmudgeon/, certainly, having been told at
the tender age of 17 by my favourite maths professor, no less, that I
had already achieved the cynicism of a 75 year old.  They call it pessimism;
I call it /being a realist/.  Never stopped me from being happy...


I now work as a consultant, principally (but not
exclusively) for small companies using [[https://clojure.org][clojure]].  



**** Notes

[fn:1] I obtained my Ph.D. from [[https://www.astro.caltech.edu/department/grad_alumni.html][Caltech in 1991]], in Cosmology, and worked 
for a few years at [[https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESTEC][the European Space Observatory]].

[fn:2] Although I worked at many places, the work I am most proud of
was performed at [[https://newsroom.accenture.com/industries/communications/accenture-to-acquire-maxamine-and-memetrics-expanding-digital-marketing-sciences-services.htm][Memetrics]], a now defunct company acquired by Accenture in 2008.

*** In the beginning...

I've been using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] pretty much daily since 1991, when I got
kicked off /deimos/, a VAX-780 in the astronomy department at Caltech.
Well, I didn't just get kicked off of it... it stopped existing, as
vaxen fell out of fashion for being cost ineffective, and the department
made the transition to a Convex, a now defunct super minicomputer.  But 
that's a story for another day.

Finding myself with a brand new Sun Sparcstation, I then had to find
another editor (at the time, I was a wiz on VMS's =EDT= editor) to write
my thesis, the manuscript of which was going to be written in TeX.  My
choices seemed to be =vi= and =emacs=, as even then I (correctly) intuited
that sticking with an emulator for a defunct system was probably not a
good long term strategy.

Emacs had this nice mode called [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AUCTeX]] to facilitate
authoring [[http://www.tug.org/][TeX]] documents.  I took the plunge, and have never looked back.
I of course totally fell for the tinkerer's malady which affects most
new emacs users, and spent more time exploring and configuring emacs
that writing my thesis (standard work avoidance tactics).

As I think back about my career in programming, it seems odd that such
an... /accidental/ choice ended up having such a deep impact on me.  Later,
I would come to appreciate emacs as a "programmable editor", learn lisp,
and eventually even build a company's technological core on [[https://common-lisp.net/][Common Lisp]];
I'm quite sure that would never have happened had I not had my eyes opened to
the existence of such deeply interactive and evolveable systems.

*** Happy, productive years go by

The next two decades saw me /living/ in emacs.  From version 18.57,
emacs rapidly developed into an actual GUI application (whoa!  modern!)
with the 19.X release.  Then we were off the the races.
Working in =C++=, then =lisp=,
reading/writing mail and usenet (using =VM= and, later, [[http://www.gnus.org/][GNUS]]), various
folding modes (until the category killer, [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] appeared in 2003),
version control (first with SVN, then [[https://www.mercurial-scm.org/][mercurial]], and, finally the
most wondrous [[https://magit.vc/][magit]], which rescues the horrible =git= from the pathetic
mess that is its UI); emacs gave me loyal service during countless
hours.  

Cryptography, programming, editing remote files, diffing, rectangle
modes... my motto became "The Answer is Emacs.  Now, what was the
question?"  Even better, as computers got faster, emacs' reputation
for being slow and resource hungry began to fade, and now this appears
quaint, as single purpose applications like =slack=, a glorified IRC
system, dwarf emacs in terms of resource usage.

Startup time?  Not a problem if you never leave it; this
session is shorter than most...  I remember getting to over
a year of uptime once.
#+begin_src lisp
(emacs-uptime)
"23 days, 7 hours, 41 minutes, 24 seconds"
#+end_src
I'm guessing I had to reboot my computer for some reason...

*** Teaching emacs

I guess I sort of ended being the emacs guru and evangelist wherever
I went, so I ended up teaching emacs to quite a few people.  I discovered
an interesting phenomenon: many people took to emacs quite enthusiastically,
but usually for different reasons!  It seems emacs has many faces, and
people need to discover their own "killer app" to see the light.

Of course, today, many, many more special purpose tools and IDEs exist
which provide much of this functionality straight out of the box
(often better), it is difficult to justify the emacs way.  Add to this
that the emacs terminology is antiquated (a "window" in emacs doesn't mean
what you think, you want a "frame", you don't "cut and paste" in emacs,
you "kill and yank") it must feel like an alien and stubbornly archaic land
to a new user.  So why should they persevere?

*** By their /tools/ shall ye know them

/Expert/ tools are not designed like tools for beginners.  I watch 
my younger colleagues, and many seem to be stuck in a form of arrested
development, paralyzed in a sort of "eternal beginner" state.  I think
it has to do with the idea of "user friendliness", which got (mis-)interpreted
as "beginner friendliness".  But a professional programmer isn't (or, at
least, shouldn't /stay)/ a beginner!  I watch them move the mouse, click,
drag, cut, scroll (again, with the mouse), click and finally paste... and
mentally calculate how long that took, how many times a day they do it,
how many days in their life they will do it for... and despair.  Not to mention
to mental interruption to the flow imposed by each of these tiny delays, each
of these additional bits of friction.

So let me be clear: I believe the young programmer should strive to make
their tool /disappear/ from their consciousness; the mechanical aspects of your
work should be as a musician playing his instrument: he thinks not of the
instrument but about the music.  The instrument "plays itself".

This is the realm in which emacs excels.  The reason for this is that it's 
more a /meta tool/ than a tool.  The opening line of the emacs manual
is essentially unchanged to this day from my hardcopy version, sixth edition, 1987:

#+begin_quote
Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor.
#+end_quote

This emphasis on /extensibility/ and /customizability/ is the essence of emacs.
Emacs works the way /you/ do, not the way around.  That is why, unlike these
other "friendly" tools, it /never/ runs out of features, nor slows you down,
nor draws attention to itself.  The price you pay for this is climbing the
steep learning curve.  Did you think this was going to be easy?  Nothing
worthwhile ever is.


*** Modern times

These days I am deeply conflicted about whether or not to recommend to young
programmers that they follow this path; it's hard for me to gauge to what extent
the time I invested in learning this tool (and the rewards I got from it) are still
achievable today.  For me, the principal win has been that I could do just about
/all/ of my work from within emacs, thus compounding efficiencies as I switched
from one [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Major-Modes.html][mode]] to another.  But the world has moved on, and working outside a
browser now becomes more and more difficult.  Even tools like the
[[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edit-with-emacs/ljobjlafonikaiipfkggjbhkghgicgoh][Edit with Emacs]] chrome browser extension only help marginally, because now
developers are made to use obnoxious tools like Jira, which (on purpose, I'm sure)
[[https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/why-we-removed-wiki-markup-editor-in-confluence-4#comments][prevent round tripping]] of their markup language to and from plain text (/i.e./ markdown).  
Furthermore, even though I still read my mail from emacs, I have to pipe it
through the browser to properly view more than half of messages I now get.
I sure long for the days of plain ASCII email...

What advice would I give a young programmer choosing today?  I would
say you should still consider =emacs= if you are the type of person who
believes in expert tools.  Emacs is not flashy or pretty out of the
box.  Remember, think of emacs not as a finished product, but as a
/toolkit/ with which to create your own, custom work environment.  Emacs
is an /investment/: you'll have to /work/ at it.  You will either find
yourself falling down the rabbit hole, and enjoying the experience, or
totally bewildered and hating it.  Both are fine!

But if you think you'll still be doing this job in 20 years, if you want to
become ever more effective at it, if you want your work tool to become
an extension of your mind, then perhaps =emacs= /is/ for you, even now, in 2020.

You'll just have to find out for yourself, won't you?

*** The Setup

I had the opportunity recently to teach the [[https://clojure.org][clojure]] programming language
to a group of interns.  I was consulting for a client who wanted
to build a team of clojure developers to maintain and extend an
application he had commissioned earlier from a small consultancy.
I agreed to train and lead a team until we felt they were "safe
without the training wheels".

This was during the start of the COVID pandemic, 
so the entire course was held remotely, via Zoom meetings, during six 
weeks, with two classes of two hours each per week.  Thus 12 lessons,
totalling 24 hours of classes.  I expected the students to spend about two
hours for each hour of course work, so they ended up having to work at
least 12 hours per week.  (I was told later that they had, in fact,
had to work quite a bit more than what I had anticipated).

The students (there were four of them) were highly motivated;
this training was part of a recruitment effort, and two of them
would most likely be hired at the end of the training; so the
classes doubled as an extended evaluation period.  I felt comfortable
with this as this was all explained up front to the students, who
got a chance to get "free training from an expert", during a period
where they could not be employed anyhow.  


*** What *they* learned

I rushed madly trying to prepare 
[[https://github.com/alain-picard/clojure-training][training materials]], which were heavily based on the
excellent online book [[https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/][Clojure for the Brave and True]]
and the [[https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans][clojure Koans]].  I had already had a chance to
review the application they would be maintaining, and so
knew that they would also to know clojurescript and the
most excellent [[https://github.com/day8/re-frame/][re-frame]] front end framework.  This meant
a /lot/ of material to cover, and I knew that just simple,
abstract exercises would not provide sufficient complexity
to get a flavour for "real" clojure programming, so I resolved
quite early on that the final outcome of the classes would
be the delivery of a small, but complete, web based application
which would be a clone of the [[https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee][New York Times Spelling Bee]] word game.


*** What *I* learned

Teaching is /hard work/.  I guess I knew this; having run away from a
potential teaching career early on[fn:3] but I ended up mentoring
quite a number of young colleagues throughout my career, and found
great satisfaction in seeing them grow.  I guess the distinction is
the degree of motivation of the student, and the intensity of focus.

Teaching clojure (and lisps in general) is deceptive: on the one hand,
the basic syntax of the language is so simple and easy to learn that
the student gets a sense of false confidence in their progress; on the
other hand, the tooling is unfamiliar (and somewhat unpolished) adding
a degree of unnecessary complexity.  

Once the initial hurdle was over,
and we were able to dive into code and exercises, the next sticking
point was definitely trying to understand /functional idioms/.  None
of my students had been exposed to the ideas behind functional
programming at University.[fn:4]  This did not greatly improve my
opinion of current CS and software engineering programs... 
The students had familiarity with the following languages: Python,
Java, C# and a little C++.  These are all language from the same
"family", and follow largely an object oriented, mutable in place
approach to software design.  Getting the students to think outside of
this particular box was challenging, but rewarding.


One aspect which surprised me, though it perhaps shouldn't have, is
that one of the most valuable teaching aspect was the detailed code
review and criticism I gave back the students to all of their
exercises.  One student wrote, giving feedback at the end of the course:
#+begin_quote
The biggest thing I found helpful in this course would definitely be
the code review.  It really helps us improve our mindset and as
programmers.
#+end_quote
Where I was basically taking them through a process analogous to what
I normally follow with junior colleagues; /i.e./ extensive coding review
emphasising not only correctness, but style, layout, design, and, what
for lack of a better word I call /good taste/, my students had never had
such feedback on their code.  Their previous experience was submitting
software to some automated test runner which ran their code, and
getting a passing grade as soon as the code ran as specified in the
assignment.  So the greatest missing piece for them was probably the
realisation that having the code simply working was by no means
enough; the aim was to write /understandable/ code.  

So, whereas universities are trying to "teach what industry wants" by
using what they think are "popular" languages, they actually fail to
instil some of the more important lessons about maintainability and
good taste.  

In the end, this was most clearly exemplified by another
comment from one of my students, who said:
 #+begin_quote
 I think I've learnt more about programming through this 45 day course
 than in my degree.
 #+end_quote


*** Outcome

I was pleasantly surprised that all of my students succeeded in
delivering a fully working clone of the spelling bee puzzle (albeit
with hard-coded data, so no automatic puzzle generation)


The students actually became very collegial and helpful towards
one another, even though they were effectively in competition with
one another.  Don't believe the garbage that the millenials are
lazy entitled brats; these guys were hardworking and friendly, and
a pleasure to interact with.


The best thing to come of of this for me was that one of the
students who was "cut" from the group eventually managed to
convince my client to hire him anyway, so we ended up with a team
of three instead of two, and he ended up being an /excellent/ hire,
so I think we really lucked out.

I am, as of this writing, still engaged with this client and continue
to teach them, now as temporary acting CTO and tech lead, and will
have truly succeeded when I have managed to make myself redundant, and
they can fully take over the maintenance and future development of
the application!


*** Footnotes

[fn:4] And they were all graduates, or soon to be graduates, of some
of the best universities in Australia.

[fn:3] I did teach an /Astronomy for Poets/ (/i.e./ introductory astronomy
for non-scientists) at UCLA right after completing my doctorate.  This
episode convinced me that teaching was /not/ my vocation.
