* This site's template

Currently using [[https://github.com/Vimux/Mainroad/][mainroad theme]].  It needs a 
lot of tweaking which hasn't been done yet.


** New blog entry

   Maybe it needs text

The question is: /who/ is doing the exporting?  I think
it's =org-hugo-auto-export-mode= in the /Local Variables/.

\( e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \)

 - Here we refer to [[/blog][Blog]]
 - And make a change
 - Here we refer to 
 #+begin_export html
 <a src="/">The home page</a>
 #+end_export

 - And here to an inner link on [[/blog/foo][the foo page]]
 - And highlighting is still failing.

 #+begin_src clojure 
   (defn foo
     "Do some foo"
     [x y]
     (log "Some foobar message")
     (+ x y))
 #+end_src

#+hugo: more

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :hl_lines 2 -n 20
  (message "This is line 1")
  (message "This is line 2")
  (message "This is line 3")
#+end_src

** Equations:

LaTeX formatted equation: \( E = -J \sum_{i=1}^N s_i s_{i+1} \)

** Another one

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
C = W\log_{2} (1+\mathrm{SNR})
\end{equation}

And that's /all/, folks!
