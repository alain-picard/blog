There was one early attempt, in hand-crafted HTML, around 1994, that I might try to resurrect for posterity\u0026hellip; but nothing since.\nWhat changed? I guess with the passage of time, my work took me from being a \u0026ldquo;producer\u0026rdquo; to being more of a \u0026ldquo;mentor\u0026rdquo;. During my career I began to notice the same problems, (and often, the same wrong solutions) over and over, so I figured I might as well write down some of my thoughts on these matters (not that I expect any to care what I think!)\nWho am I? A defrocked astronomer1, then a programmer2 in Australia, where I still reside. A rationalist because the only way we seem to have figured out things which are actually true, without lying to ourselves, is the scientific method. A curmudgeon, certainly, having been told at the tender age of 17 by my favourite maths professor, no less, that I had already achieved the cynicism of a 75 year old. They call it pessimism; I call it being a realist. Never stopped me from being happy\u0026hellip;\nI now work as a consultant, principally (but not exclusively) for small companies using clojure.\nNotes   I obtained my Ph.D. from Caltech in 1991, in Cosmology, and worked for a few years at the European Space Observatory. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Although I worked at many places, the work I am most proud of was performed at Memetrics, a now defunct company acquired by Accenture in 2008. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1596549600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596549600,"objectID":"b98767759e1931aadc4f9a05b543b431","permalink":"https://alain-picard.github.io/blog/post/welcome-message/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/blog/post/welcome-message/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome!\nIt is odd that I have been online for so long (since 1986 or so) but have never felt the need to publish content (apart from the occasional piece of open source software, here and there).","tags":null,"title":"Welcome to my corner of the internet!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Another FOO boring title And then there were none.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2fe1f8284709de3702d59c734461ad0e","permalink":"https://alain-picard.github.io/blog/foo/test/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/foo/test/","section":"foo","summary":"Another FOO boring title And then there were none.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"foo"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Some boring title And then there were none.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"61d0738002b1de6341cacde4fb904258","permalink":"https://alain-picard.github.io/blog/project/test/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/project/test/","section":"project","summary":"Some boring title And then there were none.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Some boring title And then there were some!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"81412513881eae34da4d046be1d50b92","permalink":"https://alain-picard.github.io/blog/project/test2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/project/test2/","section":"project","summary":"Some boring title And then there were some!","tags":null,"title":"","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is my about page.
